## Hello and welcome to my first website.

I am Hope Bleasdale, a student from the [Geographic Data Science Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/) at the University of Liverpool. I am studying for an integrated MSC and PhD in [Data Analytics and Society](https://datacdt.org/), researching **human dynamics within an urban and regional context**, with data from Liverpool City Region.

## Programming for Social Sciences - Agent Based Modelling 

As part of the first assignment for the 2019 Programming for Social Sciences module at Leeds, I had to create an Agent Based Model of sheep in an environment. To view my python code for this, click [here](https://github.com/Hlbleasdale/Leeds-Geog-5995).

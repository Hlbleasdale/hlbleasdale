## Hello and welcome to my first website.

I am Hope Bleasdale, a student from the [Geographic Data Science Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/) at the University of Liverpool. I am studying for an integrated MSC and PhD in [Data Analytics and Society](https://datacdt.org/), researching **human dynamics within an urban and regional context**, with data from Liverpool City Region.

## Postgraduate Education 

During the first year of my postgraduate course, I will be undertaking several modules at my home institution, [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/),
and I shall also take one module at each of my partner institutions: [University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/), [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk),
and [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/). I shall also undertake an internship at my partner company - [Liverpool City Region](https://www.liverpoolcityregion-ca.gov.uk/).

My first year modules include:

* Social Survey Analysis 
* Qualitative Research Methods 
* Analysis of Human Dynamics 
* Spatial Analysis 
* [Programming for Social Sciences](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/) - *hosted at [University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/)*
* Understanding data and their environment - *hosted at [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk)*
* Social Analytics and Visualisation - *hosted at [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/)*

## Programming for Social Sciences - Agent Based Modelling 

As part of the first assignment for the 2019 [Programming for Social Sciences](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-phd/) module at Leeds, I had to create an Agent Based Model of sheep in an environment.

An Agent Based Model simulates the actions/interactions of autonomous agents until a number of iterations have run, or a stopping condition has been reached. My Agent Based Model simulates the movement and actions of sheep in an environment. The sheep move around the environment, eat the environment and share their food stores with nearby neighbours. 

The following variables may be altered in this model:
* num_of_iterations - the number of times the sheep may move
* num_of_agents - the number of sheep in the environment 
* neighbourhood - the distance agents may be close to one another before they start sharing food stores

The model displays a number next to each agent which represents it's food store.

The model continues to run until all of the sheep have eaten enough and are full - this is the stopping condition.
